            <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites
                ; it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or 'devs', do this by using a variety of coding languages.</p>

            <p>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

                <h3>Front-end web development</h3>
                    <p>Front-end web development is responsible for the look and feel of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone. Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make sure websites are optimized for users and search engines — and with security best practices in mind. See Front-End web development Typical Programming languages below :</p>

                    <section class="sample">

                    <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>Syntax = &ltelement>(content)&lt/element></p>
                        <code>
                                &lth1> Hello World &lt/h1>
                        </code>
                    
                    <h4>CSS</h4>
                    <p>Syntax = selector {property: value}</p>
                        <code>
                                h4 {
                                    font-style: bold;

                                }
                        </code>

                    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Paragraph changed."</p>
                        <code>
                            &ltscript>
                                function myFunction() {
                                  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
                                }
                                &lt/script>
                        </code>

                    </section>
                
                <h3>Back-end web development</h3>
                    <p>Back-end web development is responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming languages include Java (different from JavaScript), PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang. Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking communities that share coding tips and support. See Back-End web development Typical Programming languages below :</p>

                    <section class="sample">

                        <h4>Java</h4>
                        <p>Syntax = public Stream&ltString> lines()</p>
                        <p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.</p>

                        <code>
                            public class Main {
                                public static void main(String[] args) {
                                  System.out.println("Hello World");
                                }
                              }
                        </code>
                    
                    <h4>PHP</h4>

                    <p>Syntax = &lt?php
                        // PHP code goes here
                        ?> </p>

                        <code>
                                &lt?php
                                echo "Hello World!";
                                ?>                        </code>

                <h3>Full-stack web development</h3>
                    <p>Full-stack web development covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending on the complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development, from the server side to the user interface. Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a build or redesign. Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen websites’ business capabilities.</p>

                <h3>React</h3>
                    <p>React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript library for developing user interfaces and related components. It employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of presentation and data availability. One of its distinguishing features is the Virtual DOM and how it handles document access and manipulation. The DOM interacts well with HTML and XML documents, causing them to behave similarly to a tree structure, and each HTML element functions as an object.</p>
                    <p>React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognised as a fantastic library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the JSX coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax to create the components. It breaks down larger components into smaller ones that can be managed separately and individually. With this feature, developers' overall productivity is bound to rise.</p>
    
                <h3>Angular</h3>
                    <p>Angular is a best frontend framework that is dominating the list of web frontend frameworks. It is a framework for creating efficient and advanced single-page applications. It is a Typescript-based development platform developed by Google. Angular is a component-based framework for developing scalable web applications, as well as a set of tools for developers to use to create, build, test, and modify code, and a collection of well-integrated libraries.</p>
                    <p>Angular allows you to scale single-page applications to enterprise-level applications based on your needs. It is currently used by YouTube and Google Translate. It also has a lot of features, making it one of the most popular frameworks.</p>
                
                <h3>Vue.js</h3>
                    <p>Vue.js is a modern, progressive MVVM framework that takes advantage of incremental adoption to the greatest extent possible. Vue.js
                        , as one of the best JavaScript libraries, has been creating interactive UI elements that are lightweight and easy to adapt. It provides data-reactive elements through a flexible and straightforward API. It is simple to complete smaller projects and then scale up to larger ones.</p>
                    <p>Vue.js is small in size and thus simple to install and download. Small and large level templates can be created, and errors can be identified quickly, saving time and effort. It simplifies the binding of existing applications and provides extensive documentation. It also assists developers in understanding peer frontend frameworks such as Angular.js, React.js, and others. Its MVVM architecture makes it easier to handle HTML blocks.</p>
